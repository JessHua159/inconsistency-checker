# Inconsistency Checker
This tool is a Python code analyzer that can find method resolution order (mro) and cycle inconsistencies in Python libraries. mro inconsistencies refer to the mismatches found from attempted mro linearization, and cycle inconsistencies refer to cyclic class inheritance.

## Usage
1. Generate the class hierarchy graph pickle dump file with
```
python get_class_hierarchy_graph.py [path to Python source code]
```
The path can be to either a Python script or a folder that contains Python source code.
`get_class_hierarchy_graph.py` creates a folder named `class_hierarchy_graphs` if not created and generates the pickle dump file in that folder: `class_hierarchy_graphs/<name of Python script or folder>_class_hierarchy_graph.pkl`.

2. Use the following script to scan the class hierarchy graph stored in the pickle dump file for mro and cycle inconsistencies:
```
python check_inheritance_consistency.py [path to pickle dump file]
```
If found, the script outputs found cycle and mro inconsistencies and creates folders `cycle_inconsistent_info` and `source_logical_inconsistent_info` with dumped information on the inconsistencies. Information on found cycle inconsistencies, the classes in a cycle, is dumped in `cycle_inconsistent_info/<name of Python script or folder>.txt`, and information on found logical inconsistencies, the classes with inconsistent mro, is dumped in `source_logical_inconsistent_info/<name of Python script or folder>.txt`. Source logical inconsistencies refer to the found mro inconsistencies.

The output has names of classes prepended by the path in dot notation relative to the root of the provided source code. For example, class `X` in `sample_inconsistent_codebase/a.py` is referred to as `sample_inconsistent_codebase.a.X`.

## Example Usage
```
python get_class_hierarchy_graph.py sample_inconsistent_codebase
python check_inheritance_consistency.py class_hierarchy_graphs\sample_inconsistent_codebase_class_hierarchy_graph.pkl
```
